        <p class="content parastyle">A 2017 review of clinical trials found that drinking coffee is generally safe
            within usual levels of intake and is more likely to improve health outcomes than to cause harm at doses of 3
            or 4 cups of coffee daily. Exceptions include possible increased risk in women having bone fractures, and a
            possible increased risk in pregnant women of fetal loss or decreased birth weight. Results were complicated
            by poor study quality, and differences in age, gender, health status, and serving size.</p>

                <h2>TYPES</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="type-para">

                <p>Coffee beans are the seeds of a fruit called a coffee cherry. Coffee cherries grow on coffee trees
                    from a genus of plants called Coffea. There are a wide variety of species of coffee plants, ranging
                    from shrubs to trees.</p>

                <ul class="m-2">
                    <li><b>Type of bean.</b> There are two main types of coffee species, Arabica and Robusta. Arabica
                        originates from Ethiopia and produces a mild, flavorful tasting coffee. It is the most popular
                        type worldwide. However, it is expensive to grow because the Arabica plant is sensitive to the
                        environment, requiring shade, humidity, and steady temperatures between 60-75 degrees
                        Fahrenheit. The Robusta coffee plant is more economical to grow because it is resistant to
                        disease and survives in a wider range of temperatures between 65 - 97 degrees Fahrenheit. It can
                        also withstand harsh climate changes such as variations in rainfall and strong sunlight.</li>
                    <li><b>Type of roast.</b> Coffee beans start out green. They are roasted at a high heat to produce a
                        chemical change that releases the rich aroma and flavor associate with coffee. They are then
                        cooled and ground for brewing. Roasting levels range from light to medium to dark. The lighter
                        the roast, lighter the color and roasted flavor and the higher its acidity and a bitter roasted
                        flavor. The popular french roast is medium-dark</li>
                    <li><b>Type of grind.</b> A medium grind is the most common and used for automatic drip coffee
                        makers. A fine grind is used for deeper flavors like espresso, releases the oils, and a coarse
                        grind is used in coffee presses.</li>
                    <li><b>Decaffeinated coffee.</b> This is an option for those who experience unpleasant side effects
                        from caffeine. The two rnost cormon mnethods used to remove apply beans, caffeine regulations,

                                    Quincy, Massachusetts (a suburb of Boston), but he changed the name in 1950 to
                                    Dunkin' Donuts after discussing with company executives.[11][12] He conceived the
                                    idea for the restaurant after his experiences selling food in factories and at
                                    construction sites, where donuts and coffee were the two most popular items.</p>
